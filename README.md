## üìò Project Overview

This project represents a foundational embedded system setup using a push-button to control an LED. Designed as part of a 4-week internship at **CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS**, it demonstrates core concepts in digital input-output interfacing and embedded C programming on microcontrollers‚Äîessential skills for any aspiring embedded systems developer.

The idea behind the project is simple but powerful: when a button is pressed, an LED lights up and display the count on LCD display ; when it is released, the LED turns off. This behavior mimics real-world interaction patterns used in numerous electronics applications‚Äîfrom household switches to user interfaces in consumer electronics and industrial systems.

The project not only introduces microcontroller basics but also enhances understanding of how hardware (buttons, LEDs, LM741 display unit ) and software (C code) communicate effectively through GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) pins.
